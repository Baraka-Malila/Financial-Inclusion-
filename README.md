Financial Inclusion in Africa
Project Overview
The Financial Inclusion in Africa project seeks to predict the likelihood of an individual possessing a bank account based on various demographic and financial service data. This analysis focuses on enhancing understanding of financial accessibility in four East African countries: Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.

Objectives
Predictive Analysis: Utilize machine learning techniques to estimate the probability of bank account ownership.
Data-Driven Insights: Explore demographic factors and financial service usage that influence financial inclusion.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance by training on 70% of the dataset and testing on the remaining 30%.
Data Description
The primary dataset comprises demographic information and financial service usage statistics from approximately 33,600 individuals across East Africa. This data has been sourced from multiple Finscope surveys conducted between 2016 and 2018, which are known for their comprehensive insights into the financial behaviors and attitudes of individuals in the region.

Key Features
Demographic Information: Age, gender, education level, and employment status.
Financial Service Usage: Access and usage of banking services, mobile money, and other financial products.
